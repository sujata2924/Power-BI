OVERVEIW 

The aim of the Hospital Patient Analysis project on Power BI is to develop a dynamic dashboard that analyzes patient demographics, treatment trends, clinical outcomes, resource allocation, and cost-effectiveness to improve decision-making and enhance the quality of care provided within the healthcare facility.

DATA SOURCE 

The patient data used in this project is obtained from a database containing information on patient admissions, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of patient journeys within the hospital, allowing us to explore and analyze key metrics using Power BI.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED 

1) Power BI Desktop: Used for data preparation, modeling, and visualization.
2) DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated columns and measures.
3) Power Query: Used for data transformation and cleansing.
4) Power BI Service: Used for sharing and collaboration.

RESULTS 
1) Distribution of patients by age, gender, and medical conditions.
2) Trends in patient admissions and discharges over time.
3) Comparative analysis of treatment outcomes for various conditions.
4) Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring of key performance metrics.
